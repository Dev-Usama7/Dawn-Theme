            "question": "What does the warranty cover?",
            "answer": "Although our <a href=\"https:\/\/bottleworx.com\/our-warranty\/\">lifetime warranty <\/a> <strong> does not cover regular wear and tear<\/strong>, such as dents, scratches, powder coat chips from the bottle being dropped or damaged, it <srong> will cover manufacturing defects, such as:\n<br>\n<strong>Broken or leaking caps<\/strong> <br>\nIf your cap breaks or you notice a leak, do not send your flask to us. Instead, simply email us. Please note you may be required to send us a photo of your cap to validate the claim. You will be responsible for the shipping charge to have the insulated water bottle \n<br>\n<strong>Bottles that no longer insulate:<\/strong> <br>\nYou can test the insulation property of your insulated stainless steel water bottle at home by adding boiling hot water to the flask. After 5 minutes, feel the outside of the flask (below the neck). If you feel any hot spots, the vacuum seal has been compromised, and you are eligible for a replacement.\n<br>\n<strong>\nBottles that are damaged during the shipping process: <\/strong><br> Please contact us if you ordered your item from bottleworx.com and it arrived damaged. If you use your new insulated bottle, we cannot replace it due to shipping damage. We will email you a prepaid shipping label to return the <a href=\"https:\/\/bottleworx.com\/return-policy\/\">damaged flask<\/a> and send out a replacement upon receipt.\n<br>\n<strong>\nRattling bottles: <\/strong><br>The rattle you hear is a small metal disc that sits between the double wall of your bottle that aids in the vacuum insulation process. Sometimes the disc becomes dislodged, and you can hear a noise. This will not affect the insulation of your bottle. If you can live with it, so can we. However, if it is an annoyance, we will exchange it for a new bottle.<\/srong>"

            "question": "What are bottleworx water bottles made with?",
            "answer": "Our insulated water bottles are made with food-grade stainless steel, the highest grade available. Why? Because the better the stainless steel, the less it absorbs, and you won’t get that horrible “tinny” taste, and far fewer “flavor transfers” as well. As an added bonus, it’s also the easiest to clean. That’s on the inside.\n<br>\nFor the outside of our reusable water bottles, we either use a non-toxic and scratch-resistant powder-coated finish, or our premium clear coat for insulated bottles without powder coating. Both provide added durability, while maintaining a very high-quality finish and feel.\n<br>\nOur Lids are made with medical-grade polypropylene, which is 100% BPA free and safe to drink from. We also use premium food-grade silicone in our stainless steel straws and gaskets."

While our vacuum insulated bottles are made to be as strong as possible, denting them can compromise the insulation. Please try your best to take care of your bottle!<\/strong><\/a>"

            "question": "Where are bottleworx bottles made?",
            "answer": "Our insulated stainless steel water bottles are made overseas in China at a factory that we have a close relationship with.\n<br>\nWhen we first launched bottleworx, our goal was to have the bottles manufactured right here at home. Unfortunately, there are literally zero factories anywhere in North America that can produce this type of quality product. With that said, we make it a priority to do as much in Canada as we possibly can.\n<br>\nFor example, we manufacture all of our silicone bands here, all of the information sleeves that go around each bottle, some of our accessories, and we also laser-engrave every single bottle right here at home. All of these options that we choose to do here in Canada are much more expensive than overseas, but we want to employ as many Canadian workers as possible.\n<br>\nOur goal, if we ever get big enough, would be to build our own factory right here on North American soil and produce water bottles made in Canada."
